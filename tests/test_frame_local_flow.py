"""A value parked in a frame slot must not lose its taint on the way back out.

PySSA models a frame op as a wide band read, and the soundness argument for the
may-analyses rests on that: a read that depends on the whole band
over-approximates, which is safe. But the argument only holds while the band is
there. When the fat expansion cannot locate it, the op falls back to the narrow
arity, where ``frame_dig`` is ``(0, 1)`` — an output with NO inputs. That is not a
wider read, it is an EMPTY one, and a value with no incoming edge reads as clean
to every may-analysis, so ``frame_bury`` a tainted value and ``frame_dig`` it back
and the taint is simply gone. False negative, not imprecision.

``frame_param_sources`` had always reconstructed one half of this (the caller
argument behind a param read). The local half — the value a ``frame_bury`` wrote
— was computed by ``frame_resolution`` and consumed ONLY by the lift, so on the
SSA layer 394 of 564 local frame reads across 40 mainnet probes had no incoming
edge at all. ``frame_local_sources`` joins the two halves
(``dig_local`` x ``bury`` on ``(slot, version)``) and
``frame_value_sources`` unions them for the MAY consumers.
